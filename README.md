# harvest-jira-worklog-integration
Puts a button in Harvest that let's you log your harvest time directly into JIRA

This idea came up after wasting a lot of time moving the tracked time from harvest to JIRA tasks. You see, JIRA and Harvest measure time differently.


# Setup

The application icon was taken from [Fontawesome](http://fontawesome.io)

Ironically some of the code was taken from [Toggle button](https://github.com/toggl/toggl-button)
